- When finished, return to the app and click **Stop Recording**. Your recording will automatically be saved and opened in the **Editor**.

<Info>Don‚Äôt worry if the start or stop part gets recorded ‚Äî you can trim it out later in the **Editor**.</Info>

### Step 3: Editing Your Video

<Tip>Tip: For advanced editing options like background changes or custom zoom animations, visit the Editing section of the docs. Here, we‚Äôll focus on trimming and adding a simple zoom effect.</Tip>

#### 1. Trimming Start and End

This section explains how to **trim the start and end of your video**. Feel free to skip this section, if you don't want to trim your video.

- On the left panel, select the **Project** item under **Layers**, then you will see the **Project Settings** on the right panel, where you find **Start Trim** and **End Trim**.

These values define where your video should start and end.

- Adjust **Start Trim** to remove unwanted delays at the beginning.
- Adjust **End Trim** to cut off the ending.

</Frame>

<Tip>Tip: You can find the exact time by playing the video or dragging the timeline pointer.</Tip>

<Warning>Trimming only marks sections for removal ‚Äî they won‚Äôt disappear inside the editor. You‚Äôll see red bars on the timeline indicating trim areas. The trimmed parts are permanently removed in the exported video.</Warning>

#### 2. Adding a Zoom Effect

This section explains how to add a simple zoom effect to your video. Feel free to skip this section, if you don't want to add a zoom effect.

- In the **Layers** panel on the left, select **Zoom Layer**. Now you may notice a **Zoom Effect Icon** that appeard above the timeline.

- Click on the **Zoom icon** to add a zoom effect at the current position of the timeline pointer. You can drag and adjust it as needed.

<Frame caption="Add zoom effect">

- Once your edits are done, click **Export** at the top right,this will open video export settings for you.

<Tip>Tip: Learn more about customizing zoom effects in the Zoom Effects section</Tip>
<Warning>Warning: Clicking Export automatically saves your latest changes. You can also click Save anytime to preserve progress manually.</Warning>

### Step 4: Exporting the Video

This section explains how to export your video. The export window allows you to choose your final video settings.

- Select your desired resolution ‚Äî you can either choose from **presets** or enter a custom value based on the **aspect ratio** set in the **Editor**.

</Frame>


#### Advanced Option: Batch Size

- The **Batch Size** represents a value that is almost synonymous to how many frames are loaded at once:
    - **Higher batch size** ‚Üí faster export but uses more memory and CPU.
    - **Lower batch size** ‚Üí slower export but lighter on performance.

- Screen Script automatically picks a suitable batch size for your device, but you can manually adjust it if needed.

<Danger>Too high batch size may cause your device to freeze or crash.</Danger>

- Once ready, click **Export** to begin rendering your video.

<Warning>Rendering is a resource-intensive process. If you switch tabs during export, your browser may throttle performance or pause rendering,which can result in errors or corrupted videos. Keep the tab open until export is complete.</Warning>
